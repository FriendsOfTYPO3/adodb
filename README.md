# TYPO3 extension ``adodb``

This extension ships the PHP database abstraction library *ADOdb* which is
mainly used by the TYPO3 extension
[dbal](https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/dbal/).

The functionality was part of TYPO3, until TYPO3 v8.4, and moved into its own
extension, receiving its own public repository.
