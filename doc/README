This folder contains the patch that has been applied to the vanilla 4.68
release of ADOdb before it has been packaged in this extension.

The changes aren't as clean as they should be, but are needed for the
DBAL extension that relies on this extension to be present. Most
other code using this ADOdb library won't notice the changes done.
